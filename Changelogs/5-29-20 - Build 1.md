# Changelog for 5/29/20 - Build 1

* Added this cool changelog text!
* Fixed errors with settings reading as \"\" and not null.
* LRTran now has a custom setting.conf file (settings-LRT.conf).
* Discord is no longer required to launch the program.

NOTE: Discord is auto disabled on startup for now until I implement it in a more stable way.
