# How to create a custom Scarf
In the /Documents/LRA/Scarves directory create a new text file and name it the name you want the scarf to be
```
#LRTran Scarf File
[Hex color], [opacity]
[Hex color], [opacity]
[Hex color], [opacity]
[Hex color], [opacity]
...
```
You can apply this scarf in Preferences -> LRTran -> Rider Settings -> Selected Scarf
