# About
[Line Rider: Advanced](https://github.com/jealouscloud/linerider-advanced) (or LRA) is an open source spiritual successor to the flash game Line Rider 6.2 with lots of new features. Not updated since 2018.

[Line Rider Advanced: Community Edition](https://github.com/RatherBeLunar/LRA-Community-Edition) (or LRA:CE) is a fork of LRA. The project's goal was to unify the best features from several existing forks (such as [LRTran](https://github.com/Tran-Foxxo/LRTran)) into one version. Not updated since 2020.

**Line Rider Overhaul** (or LRO) is a restoration project of LRA:CE. It has updated graphics, lots of bug fixes and new features to make Line Rider more user friendly.
